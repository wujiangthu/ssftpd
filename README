   SSftpd is a high performance and very secure ftp server, based on nginx. Instead of creaeting a new process serving each ftp request, which is adopted by other ftp servers, ssftpd uses io mutilplexing such as epoll, kqueue, select, poll, dev/poll to deal with the incoming requests, saving a lot of memory resource and running time.
   Moreover, ssftp cares much about security from design to implement, making server safe as far as possible.

   PS : SSftpd is not released yet, but most of it has been implemented. It will be completed and released as soon as posssible :)
