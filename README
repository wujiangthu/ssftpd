   SSftpd is a high performance and very secure ftp server, based on nginx. Instead of creaeting a new process serving each ftp request, which is adopted by other ftp servers, ssftpd uses io mutilplexing such as epoll, kqueue, select, poll, dev/poll to deal with the incoming requests, saving a lot of memory resource and running time.
Moreover, ssftp cares much about security from design to implement, making server safe as far as possible.

   Supported features:
       ●  Very large number of concurrent users
       ●  Multiple virtual servers based on IP
       ●  Virtual users
       ●  Standalone or xinetd mode
       ●  FTPS (FTP over SSL)
       ●  PAM authentication
       ●  Cross platform
       ●  etc…


   PS : SSftpd is not released yet, but most of it has been implemented. It will be completed and released as soon as posssible :) 
   
  ** Most ssftpd related code is under src/ftp. **
